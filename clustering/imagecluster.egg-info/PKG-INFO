Description: ``imagecluster`` is a package for clustering images by content. We use a
        pre-trained deep convolutional neural network to calculate image fingerprints
        which represent content. Those are used to cluster similar images. In addition
        to pure image content, it is possible to mix in timestamp information which
        improves clustering for temporally uncorrelated images.
